# Development and investigation of efficient artificial bee colony algorithm for numerical function optimization

This repo contains code to reproduce results from the article "Development and investigation of efficient artificial bee colony algorithm for numerical function optimization" [1]

This code uses some files from watchmaker [2], which were copied into the [src directory](./src/):
- EvaluatedCandidate.java
- RouletteWheelSelection.java
- SelectionStrategy.java
- StochasticUniversalSampling.java
